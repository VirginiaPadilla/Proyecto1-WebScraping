      "Fecha:  2022-07-08T16:30:02+00:00\n",
      "Autor:  TEDx Talks\n",
      "Descripcion:  Medicine is designed to work for most of us, most of the time – but what of those who fall through the cracks? Or those who get severe side effects? The nature of medical care generalising for the average human must change to address this. Easier said, than done. This is the last mile of Medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew J. McGovern grew up seeing how easy it was for him to fit into school and society whilst his sister Áine, with Autism, had many more blocks to get around just to live. This unique perspective has brought him in his career as a neuroscientist  to study precision medicine, specifically looking at sex differences in disease. The history of medicine is littered with male-dominated focus and women left to the wayside, even in the face of diseases which discriminate between the sexes. Alzheimer’s, autism, depression and rheumatoid arthritis all effect more women than men, yet we have only included women in clinical trials since this 90’s and preclinical trials as recent as 2016. \n",
      "He see’s addressing sex differences as the first step, among many, towards a better more precise medicine for the individual. Towards better dosing, less side effects, more success and better lives – but it will take work, money, passion and people, good people. \n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew J. McGovern is a neuroscientist at the University of Limerick who studies sex differences in neurological disease. He joined the neurosciences in University College Cork studying sex differences in the brain following early life stress in relation to anxiety. After this Andrew joined the University of Limerick as a teaching assistant before being offered a scholarship to study sex differences (genetic and hormonal) in metabolism. He hopes this work may explain sex differences in diseases which could inform more precise treatment strategies. He is an award-winning science communicator who talks science on his podcast Living Room Logic which peaked at #1 science podcast in Ireland and TikTok @ScientistIreland which has over 3.5m views. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Andrew was invited by a member of NPHET to communicate COVID-19 information to young adults. This work was highlighted by the European Centre of Disease Control as best practice in COVID-19 and vaccine communications.

      "Descripcion:  What if? What if there was a different way? 9th grader Geri Kayingo begs this question as she explores the relationship between moving humanity forward, and the cultural division that our world faces today. So many miscommunications and painful interactions stem from a lack of understanding between different types of people. Through poetry, she describes one of these moments that she personally experienced. To prevent these incidents, we must bridge the gap that prevents us from relating to each other. Geri offers this solution: empowering today’s youth to seek diverse identities through student-led learning. By providing learners with a powerful platform, we can create a more aware, connected world.   Geri Kayingo is a 9th grade student at Roland Park Country School in Baltimore, Maryland, where she studies languages, humanities, and STEM disciplines. Growing up she enjoyed swimming and playing the flute.\n",

      "Currently, her main focus is writing. From an early age she has been an avid reader and writer. For the past year she has been an active member of The Young Writers Project (YWP), an online community of youth writers based in Vermont. Through this initiative Geri has been a guest speaker on the website’s podcast Line Break, interviewed award winning author and anthologist Dana Walrath, and has been published on multiple accounts in The Voice, YWP’s digital newspaper. Among her poetic contributions are pieces such as 2020: The Recipe and Truly Alone, in which she explores life during the pandemic and emotional trauma. She also submits poetry to her school’s newspaper The Reds Report. Her most recent piece Memories Marked in Snow was published in the February 2022 issue.
